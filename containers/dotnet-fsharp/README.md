## Using this definition

### Debug Configuration

Only the integrated terminal is supported by the Remote - Containers extension. You may need to modify your `.vscode/launch.json` configurations to include the following:

```json
"console": "integratedTerminal"
```

**Note:** Currently the Ionide-fsharp extension appears to force the use of an external console when clicking on the Debug icon in the F# Solution Explorer. You can configure a .NET application launch [in `launch.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) with the property above instead.

### Enabling HTTPS in ASP.NET using your own dev certificate

To enable HTTPS in ASP.NET, you can mount an exported copy of your local dev certificate.

1. Export it using the following command:

    **Windows PowerShell**

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "$env:USERPROFILE/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
    ```

    **macOS/Linux terminal**

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
    ```

2. Add the following in to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

    ```json
    "remoteEnv": {
        "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password": "SecurePwdGoesHere",
        "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path": "/home/vscode/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx",
    }
    ```

3. Finally, make the certificate available in the container as follows:

    **If using GitHub Codespaces and/or Remote - Containers**

    1. Start the container/codespace
    2. Drag `~/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx` from your local machine into the root of the File Explorer in VS Code.
    3. Open a terminal in VS Code and run:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p /home/vscode/.aspnet/https && mv aspnetapp.pfx /home/vscode/.aspnet/https
        ```

    **If using only Remote - Containers with a local container**

    Add the following to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

    ```json
    "mounts": [ "source=${env:HOME}${env:USERPROFILE}/.aspnet/https,target=/home/vscode/.aspnet/https,type=bind" ]
    ```

If you've already opened your folder in a container, rebuild the container using the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) so the settings take effect.

### Installing Node.js or the Azure CLI

Given JavaScript front-end web client code written for use in conjunction with an ASP.NET back-end often requires the use of Node.js-based utilities to build, this container also includes `nvm` so that you can easily install Node.js. You can change the version of Node.js installed or disable its installation by updating the `args` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

```jsonc
"args": {
    "VARIANT": "3.1",
    "NODE_VERSION": "14" // Set to "none" to skip Node.js installation
}
```

If you would like to install the Azure CLI, you can reference [a dev container feature](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/dev-container-features) by adding the following to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "azure-cli": "latest"
  }
}
```

If you've already opened your folder in a container, rebuild the container using the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) so the settings take effect.

### Adding the definition to your folder

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please see getting started information on [setting up](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) Remote-Containers or [creating a codespace](https://aka.ms/ghcs-open-codespace) using GitHub Codespaces.

2. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.

3. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command for **Remote-Containers** or **Codespaces**.

   > **Note:** If needed, you can drag-and-drop the `.devcontainer` folder from this sub-folder in a locally cloned copy of this repository into the VS Code file explorer instead of using the command.

4. Select this definition. You may also need to select **Show All Definitions...** for it to appear.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** to start using the definition.

## Testing the definition

This definition includes some test code that will help you verify it is working as expected on your system. Follow these steps:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Start VS Code, press <kbd>F1</kbd>, and select **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...**
4. Select the `containers/dotnetcore-fsharp` folder.
5. When prompted click "Restore" in the notification to restore packages.
6. After the folder has opened in the container, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start the project.
7. You should see "Hello Remote World from the F# Container!" in a terminal window after the program executes.
8. From here, you can add breakpoints or edit the contents of the `test-project` folder to do further testing.
