## Using this definition

 While the definition itself works unmodified, you can select the version of Alpine the container uses by updating the `VARIANT` arg in the included `devcontainer.json` (and rebuilding if you've already created the container).

```json
"args": { "VARIANT": "3.14" }
```

You can also directly reference pre-built versions of `.devcontainer/base.Dockerfile` by using the `image` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or updating the `FROM` statement in your own  `Dockerfile` to one of the following. An example `Dockerfile` is included in this repository.

- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:alpine` (latest)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:alpine-3.12`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:alpine-3.13`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:alpine-3.14`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:alpine-3.15`

You can decide how often you want updates by referencing a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) of each image. For example:

- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:0-alpine`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:0.204-alpine`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:0.204.0-alpine`

See [history](history) for information on the contents of each version and [here for a complete list of available tags](https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/vscode/devcontainers/base/tags/list).

Alternatively, you can use the contents of `base.Dockerfile` to fully customize your container's contents or to build it for a container host architecture not supported by the image.

Beyond `git`, this image / `Dockerfile` includes `zsh`, [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/), a non-root `vscode` user with `sudo` access, and a set of common dependencies for development.

### A note on extensions

However, note that some extensions may not work in Alpine Linux due to `glibc` dependencies in native code inside the extension. You should also be aware that 3rd party tools, runtimes, and SDKs may not include a version that works on Alpine Linux for the same reason.

See [Remote Development and Linux](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/linux) for details.

### Adding the definition to a project or codespace

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please see getting started information on [setting up](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) Remote-Containers or [creating a codespace](https://aka.ms/ghcs-open-codespace) using GitHub Codespaces.

2. To use the pre-built image:
   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command for **Remote-Containers** or **Codespaces**.
   3. Select this definition. You may also need to select **Show All Definitions...** for it to appear.

3. To build a custom version of the image instead:
   1. Clone this repository locally.
   2. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.
   3. Use your local operating system's file explorer to drag-and-drop the locally cloned copy of the `.devcontainer` folder for this definition into the VS Code file explorer for your opened project or codespace.
   4. Update `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to reference `"dockerfile": "base.Dockerfile"`.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** to start using the definition.
