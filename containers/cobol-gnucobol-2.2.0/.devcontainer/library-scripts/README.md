# Warning: Folder contents may be replaced

The contents of this folder will be automatically replaced with a file of the same name in the [vscode-dev-containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers) repository's [script-library folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/script-library) whenever the repository is packaged.  To retain your edits, move the file to a different location. You may also delete the files if they are not needed.

## Adding a new script from the script-library folder

When creating a dev container for the vscode-dev-containers repository, simply drop a copy of the script you want to use from the [script-library folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/script-library) into this folder and it will be automatically kept up to date as things change.
