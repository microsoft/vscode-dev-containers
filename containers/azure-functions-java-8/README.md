## Using this definition

This definition requires an Azure subscription to use. You can create a [free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/serverless/), learn more about using [Azure Functions with VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-vs-code) and [Java Azure Functions with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-azurefunctions) here. Once you have an Azure account, follow these steps:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please see getting started information on [setting up](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) Remote-Containers or [creating a codespace](https://aka.ms/ghcs-open-codespace) using GitHub Codespaces.

2. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.

3. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command for **Remote-Containers** or **Codespaces**. 

   > **Note:** If needed, you can drag-and-drop the `.devcontainer` folder from this sub-folder in a locally cloned copy of this repository into the VS Code file explorer instead of using the command.

4. Select this definition. You may also need to select **Show All Definitions...** for it to appear.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** to start using the definition.
