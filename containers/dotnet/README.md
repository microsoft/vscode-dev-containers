## Using this definition

While this definition should work unmodified, you can select the version of .NET / .NET Core the container uses by updating the `VARIANT` arg in the included `devcontainer.json` (and rebuilding if you've already created the container).

```json
// Or you can use 3.1-bullseye or 3.1-focal if you want to pin to an OS version
"args": { "VARIANT": "3.1" }
```

Note that .NET 6.0 has switched its default OS to Debian 12 / bullseye. We also offer a `6.0-focal` image if you would prefer to use Ubuntu 20.04 / Focal.

You can also directly reference pre-built versions of `.devcontainer/base.Dockerfile` by using the `image` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or updating the `FROM` statement in your own  `Dockerfile` to one of the following. An example `Dockerfile` is included in this repository.

- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/dotnet` (latest)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/dotnet:3.1` (or `3.1-bullseye`, `3.1-focal` to pin to an OS version)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/dotnet:5.0` (or `5.0-bullseye`, `5.0-focal` to pin to an OS version)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/dotnet:6.0` (or `6.0-bullseye`, `6.0-focal` to pin to an OS version)

You can decide how often you want updates by referencing a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) of each image. For example:

- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/dotnet:0-3.1`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/dotnet:0.202-3.1`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/dotnet:0.202.0-3.1`

See [history](history) for information on the contents of each version and [here for a complete list of available tags](https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/vscode/devcontainers/dotnet/tags/list).

Alternatively, you can use the contents of `base.Dockerfile` to fully customize your container's contents or to build it for a container host architecture not supported by the image.

### Debug Configuration

Only the integrated terminal is supported by the Remote - Containers extension. You may need to modify your `.vscode/launch.json` configurations to include the following:

```json
"console": "integratedTerminal"
```

### Enabling HTTPS in ASP.NET using your own dev certificate

To enable HTTPS in ASP.NET, you can mount an exported copy of your local dev certificate.

1. Export it using the following command:

    **Windows PowerShell**

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "$env:USERPROFILE/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
    ```

    **macOS/Linux terminal**

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
    ```

2. Add the following in to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

    ```json
    "remoteEnv": {
        "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password": "SecurePwdGoesHere",
        "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path": "/home/vscode/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx",
    }
    ```

3. Finally, make the certificate available in the container as follows:

    **If using GitHub Codespaces and/or Remote - Containers**

    1. Start the container/codespace
    2. Drag `~/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx` from your local machine into the root of the File Explorer in VS Code.
    3. Open a terminal in VS Code and run:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p /home/vscode/.aspnet/https && mv aspnetapp.pfx /home/vscode/.aspnet/https
        ```

    **If using only Remote - Containers with a local container**

    Add the following to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

    ```json
    "mounts": [ "source=${env:HOME}${env:USERPROFILE}/.aspnet/https,target=/home/vscode/.aspnet/https,type=bind" ]
    ```

If you've already opened your folder in a container, rebuild the container using the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) so the settings take effect.

### Installing Node.js or the Azure CLI

Given JavaScript front-end web client code written for use in conjunction with an ASP.NET back-end often requires the use of Node.js-based utilities to build, this container also includes `nvm` so that you can easily install Node.js. You can change the version of Node.js installed or disable its installation by updating the `args` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

```jsonc
"args": {
    "VARIANT": "3.1",
    "NODE_VERSION": "14" // Set to "none" to skip Node.js installation
}
```

If you would like to install the Azure CLI, you can reference [a dev container feature](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/dev-container-features) by adding the following to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "azure-cli": "latest"
  }
}
```

If you've already opened your folder in a container, rebuild the container using the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) so the settings take effect.

### Adding the definition to your folder

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please see getting started information on [setting up](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) Remote-Containers or [creating a codespace](https://aka.ms/ghcs-open-codespace) using GitHub Codespaces.

2. To use the pre-built image:
   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command for **Remote-Containers** or **Codespaces**.
   4. Select this definition. You may also need to select **Show All Definitions...** for it to appear.

3. To build a custom version of the image instead:
   1. Clone this repository locally.
   2. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.
   3. Use your local operating system's file explorer to drag-and-drop the locally cloned copy of the `.devcontainer` folder for this definition into the VS Code file explorer for your opened project or codespace.
   4. Update `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to reference `"dockerfile": "base.Dockerfile"`.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** to start using the definition.

## Testing the definition

This definition includes some test code that will help you verify it is working as expected on your system. Follow these steps:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Start VS Code, press <kbd>F1</kbd>, and select **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...**
4. Select the `containers/dotnet` folder.
5. After the folder has opened in the container, if prompted to restore packages in a notification, click "Restore".
6. After packages are restored, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start the project.
7. Once the project is running, open your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8090. Or, in the Debug Console view, select the "http://0.0.0.0:8090" link.
8. You should see "Hello remote world from ASP.NET!" after the page loads.
9. From here, you can add breakpoints or edit the contents of the `test-project` folder to do further testing.
