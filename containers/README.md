# Development Container Definitions

This folder contains a set of development container configuration files or "definitions" that are included with the [Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers) extension. This list is presented when you open a folder in a container that does not already have a `.devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in it.

Each folder contains a README with more details on the contents of the definition and how to use it.

See [CODESPACES.md](CODESPACES.md) for information on which are expected to work with Visual Studio Codespaces.
