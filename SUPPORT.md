## How to file issues and get help

We've migrated most of the contents of this repo to the [devcontainers org](https://github.com/devcontainers), as part of the work on the [open Dev Container specification](https://containers.dev).

- Features managed by the Dev Container spec maintainers (such as the VS Code team) are now in [devcontainers/features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features).
- Definitions/Templates managed by the Dev Container spec maintainers are now in [devcontainers/templates](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates).
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers` and `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers` images are now published from [devcontainers/images](https://github.com/devcontainers/images). Information on image updates, patching, and deprecation [can be found in this pinned tracking issue](hhttps://github.com/devcontainers/images/issues/90).


As a result, this repository is only used for community definitions that have not been migrated elsewhere by their owners. If you are a community owner and want us to remove an existing definition here, feel free to submit a PR to do so!

For new Templates/Features, you can now self-publish and optionally make them visible in-tool by following the steps one of the quick start repositories: [Templates quick start](https://github.com/devcontainers/template-starter), [Features quick start](https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-starter). No need to submit a PR here anymore.

You can also:

- Provide feedback for the [VS Code Dev Containers](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-release/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) extension or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/categories/codespaces).
- Discuss the [Dev Container spec](https://github.com/orgs/devcontainers/discussions) or [join the Slack channel](https://github.com/orgs/devcontainers/discussions/3)
- Make proposals for improvments to the [Dev Container spec repository](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec).
- Contribute to the [Dev Container CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli).
