MENU TRANSCRIPT

Before we get started, lets take a look at the course objectives. By the end of this course, contractors will be able to:

Distinguish the different laws enforced by OFCCP

Identify basic Equal Employment Opportunity obligations of a construction contractor

• Describe the participation goals for women and minorities for construction contractors

• Determine compliance with the Sixteen Affirmative Action Steps requirement for construction contractors

					We will request information about the check or other withdrawal order to be stopped:			"USE OF CHECK IMAGES AND SUBSTITUTE CHECKS
For each original check that you deposit, you hereby authorize us (and any collecting bank, returning bank, Reserve Bank or processor that subsequently receives the original check) to create an electronic image (""check image"") of the original check and to process that check image for collection, payment and return. You further authorize the destruction of the original check that has been imaged. We may in our sole discretion determine the manner in which to collect or return a check image. We may (i) present or transfer the check image to the paying bank, a Federal Reserve Bank, a check clearing house, image exchange network or Other collecting bank or returning bank; or (ii) create a substitute check and collect such substitute check (governed by the
Check Collection for the 21 st Century Act referred to here as the ""Check 21 Act"") instead of the check image. A check image or a substitute check may be collected through one or more check clearinghouses, through one or more Federal Reserve Banks, or pursuant to an exchange agreement with another depository institution. In such cases, you agree that the check image or substitute check is subject to the rules of that clearinghouse, Federal Reserve Bank or exchange agreement.
You agree that we may debit your Account for any of the following items: (i) a check image of an original check drawn on your Account and presented for payment or collection, or (ii) a returned check image of an original check that was deposited by you. In these situations, we may debit your Account wÅthout receipt of, or review of, the original check associated with the check image. In our sole discretion, we may return to a presenting bank, returning bank or paying bank, or post to your Account, a paper copy or paper representation of an original check (including without limitation an image replacement document or IRD, or a photocopy) drawn on or returned to your Account that does not otherwise meet the technical or legal requirements for a substitute check.
You agree that a check image that is received or created by the Bank in the check deposit, collection or return process shall be considered a ""check"" and/or an ""item"" for all purposes under this Agreement and applicable law.
In addition, a check that you deposit with us, or that you draw on your Account, may be truncated in the check collection process and replaced with a substitute check. You authorize us to pay, process or return a substitute check in the same manner as ""check"" or ""item"" under this Agreement. Substitute checks are governed under the Check 21 Act and the terms of this Agreement, to the extent not modified by the Check 21 Act."

ABSOLUTELY ACCURATELY, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THE ITEM YOU WANT STOPPED WILL NOT BE PAID.
In the event that we inadvertently pay an item over your valid stop payment order, we may refuse to recredit your Account if you owed the money to the payee(s). You will be required to provide evidence satisfactory to us of the amount of your loss. If we recredit your Account, you shall be deemed to have assigned to us all of your rights against the payee(s), both on the item and on the underlying claim, and we may require you to sign an affidavit that you did not receive full value from the transaction for which the check was issued and otherwise cooperate in our recovery efforts.
You may also stop payment on any Visa recurring preauthorized payment originated by use of your Business Visa Debit Card. These Visa stop payment orders must be made at least three (3) business days prior to the scheduled posting date of the transaction and shall be effective for two (2) years from the date the order is received. At least one (1) transaction must have previously posted.

FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY FOR BUSINESS ACCOUNTS"																																				
					"Effective June 26, 2020
Introducing Our Funds Availability Policy
When you deposit checks and similar items to your PNC Bank account, you expect us to make the funds available for your use as quickly as possible. Our Funds Availability Policy is designed to do just that. Depending on the type of non-cash deposit you make, your funds may be available as quickly as the next business day. Of course, depending on the amount, type and source of your non-cash deposit, there are situations when your deposit will take longer to become available for your use."																																				
					"Our Funds Availability Policy provides detailed information about when funds you deposit will become available for your use. This policy is in effect for accounts opened in all PNC Bank markets.
Please take a moment to review this Policy. By understanding how we make your deposits of non-cash items available, it will be easier for you to manage your account and realize all the benefits of banking with PNC Bank.
Determining Availability of a Deposit

If a deposit is received through one of our branch tellers, ATM, mobile device, remote deposit scanner, electronic deposit (i.e. ACH, Zelle@, Real-Time Payments), or by mail before our cut-off time, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if a deposit is received after our cut-off time or on a day that is not a business day, we will consider the deposit as being received on the next business day that we are open. With the exception of deposits made at non-PNC ATMs, our cut-off time is 10:00 p.m. ET. The cut-off time for deposits made at non-PNC Bank ATMs is 3:00 p.m. ET.
Further, deposits made through our night depository after 6:00 a.m. ET may be processed on the next business day.
Availability varies depending on the type of deposit and is explained below.

				Your account was overdrawn and may require immediate attention.																																					
				Here’s what happened: On April 26, 2022, your account was overdrawn. A total of 1 transaction(s) were returned unpaid. See below																																					
				for the transaction details. Your account may be subject to a fee each time we pay a transaction or decline a																																					
				payment due to insufficient funds.																																					
				Total charges for 1 items $36																																					
				The total charges for 1 items paid into overdraft and/or returned unpaid due to insufficient funds is $36.00.																																					
				Please adjust your records by the amount of this charge.																																					
				NOTE: The maximum number of paid or returned items PNC will charge on a business day is 4. The remainder																																					
				of the items, if any, will be paid or returned with no charge.																																					
				Here’s what you need to																																					
				do immediately:																																					
				Check your balance and, if needed, make a deposit so there is enough money to bring your account above $0																																					
				and cover any declined payments as well as transactions you made that have not yet been deducted from your																																					
				account. Remember to include ACH transactions, online bill payments and debit card activity that have not yet																																					
				been deducted from your account, in addition to checks you wrote that haven't yet been cashed. The quickest																																					
				way to make a deposit is to transfer money online, by phone, by PNC ATM, or bring cash to your local PNC																																					
				branch.																																					
				It is important to make a deposit as soon as possible.																																					
				#barcode																																					
				Here’s why it happened: Even though you deposit and withdraw money throughout the day, we don't finalize these transactions until																																					
				the end of the day. At the end of each business day, we add the money that went into your account before																																					
				subtracting the money that went out of it. If that results in a negative available balance, your account is																																					
				overdrawn.																																					
				Here are your current																																					
				account settings:																																					
				Overdraft Protection has not been established for this account. Please contact us if you would like to set																																					
				up this service.																																					
				Overdraft Coverage: Your account is currently Opted In. You or your joint owner may revoke your																																					
				opt-in or opt-out choice at any time. To learn more about PNC Overdraft Solutions, visit us online at																																					
				pnc.com/overdraftsolutions. To manage both your Overdraft Coverage and Overdraft Protection																																					
				settings, call 1-877-588-3605, visit any branch, or sign on to PNC Online Banking, and select the																																					
				Overdraft Solutions link under the Account Services section.
