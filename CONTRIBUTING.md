# Contributing

We've migrated most of the contents of this repo to the [devcontainers org](https://github.com/devcontainers), as part of the work on the [open Dev Container specification](https://containers.dev).

- Features managed by the Dev Container spec maintainers (such as the VS Code team) are now in [devcontainers/features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features).
- Definitions/Templates managed by the Dev Container spec maintainers are now in [devcontainers/templates](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates).
- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers` and `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers` images are now published from [devcontainers/images](https://github.com/devcontainers/images).

As a result, this repository is only used for community definitions that have not been migrated elsewhere by their owners. If you are a community owner and want us to remove an existing definition here, feel free to submit a PR to do so!

For new Templates/Features, you can now self-publish and optionally make them visible in-tool by following the steps one of the quick start repositories: [Templates quick start](https://github.com/devcontainers/template-starter), [Features quick start](https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-starter). No need to submit a PR here anymore.
