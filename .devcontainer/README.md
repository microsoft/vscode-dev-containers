# Dev Container for vscode-dev-containers

This folder includes a configuration for building dev containers or reviewing PRs inside of another dev container - "Inception" style 😎. It includes the Moby/Docker and a desktop with VS Code stable, insiders, and the Remote - Containers extension installed for quick testing of local scenarios when needed.

A web-based desktop viewer is automatically forwarded. The login password is `vscode`.

Run <kbd>F1</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> and select **Ports: Focus on Ports View** to see the address to use to connect to it.

However, most likely, this was not what you were looking for when you came to this repository. Actual dev container definitions can be found [under the `/containers` folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers) in this repository.
