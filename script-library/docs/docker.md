# Docker-from-Docker Install Script

*Adds the Docker CLI to a container along with a script to enable using a forwarded Docker socket within a container to run Docker commands.*

**Script status**: Stable

**OS support**: Debian 9+, Ubuntu 16.04+, CentOS/RHEL 7+ (community supported) and downstream distros.

**Maintainer:** The VS Code and GitHub Codespaces teams, [@smankoo](https://github.com/smankoo) (`docker-redhat.sh`)

> **Note:** `docker-redhat.sh` is community supported.

## Syntax

```text
./docker-debian.sh [Non-root access flag] [Source socket] [Target socket] [Non-root user] [Use Moby]
./docker-redhat.sh [Non-root access flag] [Source socket] [Target socket] [Non-root user]
```

|Argument|Default|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
|Non-root access flag|`true`| Flag (`true`/`false`) that specifies whether a non-root user should be granted access to the Docker socket.|
|Source socket|`/var/run/docker-host.sock`| Location that the host's Docker socket has been mounted in the container.|
|Target socket|`/var/run/docker.sock`| Location within the container that the Docker CLI will expect to find the Docker socket with permissions that allow the non-root user to access it.|
|Non-root user|`automatic`| Specifies a user in the container other than root that will be using the desktop. A value of `automatic` will cause the script to check for a user called `vscode`, then `node`, `codespace`, and finally a user with a UID of `1000` before falling back to `root`. |
|Use Moby|`true`| Specifies that a build of the open source [Moby CLI](https://github.com/moby/moby/tree/master/cli) should be used instead of the Docker CLI distribution of it. |

## Usage

See the [`docker-from-docker`](../../containers/docker-from-docker) and [`docker-from-docker-compose`](....//containers/docker-from-docker) definition for a complete working example. However, here are the general steps to use the script:

1. Add [`docker-debian.sh`](../docker-debian.sh) or [`docker-redhat.sh`](../docker-redhat.sh) to `.devcontainer/library-scripts`

2. Add the following to your `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`:

    ```Dockerfile
    COPY library-scripts/docker-debian.sh /tmp/library-scripts/
    ENV DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
    RUN apt-get update && bash /tmp/library-scripts/docker-debian.sh
    ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/share/docker-init.sh"]
    CMD ["sleep", "infinity"]
    ```

    For CentOS/RedHat, simply replace the `RUN` above with:

    ```Dockerfile
    RUN bash /tmp/library-scripts/docker-redhat.sh
    ```

    Note that the `ENTRYPOINT` script can be chained with another script by adding it to the array after `docker-init.sh`.

3. And the following to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you are referencing an image or Dockerfile:

    ```json
    "runArgs": ["--init"],
    "mounts": [ "source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker-host.sock,type=bind" ],
    "overrideCommand": false
    ```

    Or if you are referencing a Docker Compose file, add this to your `docker-compose.yml` file instead:
    
    ```yaml
    your-service-name-here:
      init: true
      volumes:
        - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker-host.sock
    ```

    While technically optional, `--init` enables an [init process](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#specify-an-init-process) to properly handle signals and ensure [Zombie Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process) are cleaned up.

4. If you are running the container as something other than root (either via `USER` in your Dockerfile or `containerUser`), you'll need to ensure that the user has `sudo` access. (If you run the container as root and just reference the user in `remoteUser` you will not have this problem, so this is recommended instead.) The [`debian-common.sh`](common.md) script can do this for you, or you [set one up yourself](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/non-root).

### Supporting bind mounts from the workspace folder

A common question that comes up is how you can use `bind` mounts from the Docker CLI from within the Codespace itself (e.g. via `-v`). The trick is that, since you're actually using Docker sitting outside of the container, the paths will be different than those in the container. You need to use the **host**'s paths instead.

> **Note:** The docker-from-docker approach does not currently enable bind mounting locations outside of the workspace folder.

#### GitHub Codespaces

In GitHub Codespaces, the workspace folder should work with bind mounts by default, so no further action is required.

#### Remote - Containers

A simple way to do this is to put `${localWorkspaceFolder}` in an environment variable that you then use when doing bind mounts inside the container.

Add the following to `devcontainer.json`:

```json
"remoteEnv": { "LOCAL_WORKSPACE_FOLDER": "${localWorkspaceFolder}" }
```

Then reference the env var when running Docker commands from the terminal inside the container.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v ${LOCAL_WORKSPACE_FOLDER}:/workspace debian bash
```
